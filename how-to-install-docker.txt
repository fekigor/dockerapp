NB!!!! Installing Docker on Ubuntu Quick Fix
URL: http://tekhead.it/2014/09/installing-docker-on-ubuntu-quick-fix/

I've installed the linux-image-extra-3.19.0-33-generic package (additional drivers), and it fixed the issue without reboot.
sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-3.19.0-33  linux-headers-3.19.0-33-generic

NB! If you have old containers (from example course delete it and other trash):
rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*

Prerequisites by Ubuntu Version
Ubuntu Wily 15.10
Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 (LTS)
For Ubuntu Trusty and Wily, it’s recommended to install the linux-image-extra kernel package. The linux-image-extra package allows you use the aufs storage driver.

To install the linux-image-extra package for your kernel version:

Open a terminal on your Ubuntu host.

Update your package manager.

$ sudo apt-get update
Install the recommended package.

$ sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)
Go ahead and install Docker.

If you are installing on Ubuntu 14.04 or 12.04, apparmor is required. You can install it using: apt-get install apparmor


Update your apt sources
Docker’s APT repository contains Docker 1.7.1 and higher. To set APT to use packages from the new repository:

If you haven’t already done so, log into your Ubuntu instance as a privileged user.

Open a terminal window.

Update package information, ensure that APT works with the https method, and that CA certificates are installed.

 $ apt-get update
 $ apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
Add the new GPG key.

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
Open the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list file in your favorite editor.

If the file doesn’t exist, create it.

Remove any existing entries.

Add an entry for your Ubuntu operating system.

The possible entries are:

On Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (LTS)

deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-precise main
On Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 (LTS)

deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main
Ubuntu Wily 15.10

deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-wily main
Note: Docker does not provide packages for all architectures. To install docker on a multi-architecture system, add an [arch=...] clause to the entry. Refer to the Debian Multiarch wiki for details.

Save and close the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list file.

Update the APT package index.

$ apt-get update
Purge the old repo if it exists.

$ apt-get purge lxc-docker
Verify that APT is pulling from the right repository.

$ apt-cache policy docker-engine
From now on when you run apt-get upgrade, APT pulls from the new repository.
